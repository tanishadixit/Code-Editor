# CodePlayer Web Application

Welcome to the CodePlayer web application! This project showcases a simple web development tool that allows you to experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time.

## Files

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the CodePlayer application. It includes the user interface elements, toggle buttons, textareas for code input, and the output iframe.

- `styles.css`: This external CSS file contains the styling for the CodePlayer application. It defines the visual appearance of the top bar, toggle buttons, textareas, and other components.

- `scripts.js`: This JavaScript file provides the interactive behavior for the CodePlayer application. It handles actions such as updating the output panel based on user input, toggling panel visibility, and handling events like button clicks.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to launch the CodePlayer application.

3. Use the toggle buttons to switch between HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Output panels.

4. Enter your code in the respective textareas and see the real-time output in the Output panel.

5. Experiment, edit, and play around with the code to learn and explore web development concepts.

## Notes

- Make sure to have an active internet connection when using this application, as it relies on external resources like jQuery.

- If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting section below or seek assistance from the project contributors.

## Troubleshooting

- If the application is not behaving as expected, open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12) and check for JavaScript errors in the console.

- Ensure that all files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `scripts.js`, and `jquery-2.2.0.min.js`) are in the same directory and have the correct file names and paths.

- If interactions are not working, verify that your browser supports the features used in the application.

For any questions or support, feel free to reach out to the project contributors.
